Here are some instructions that explain how to add flares to this Table.


1) Run Bayesian Blocks on the event files and find the flares
2) If there are flares, then you may want to add them to this database.
3) Take note of the information provided in the Table; flare starting and ending times in MJD, the quiescent count rate, the flare count rate (pile-up corrected (only for Chandra observations)), the peak count rate (from a 300s binning), the exposure, the flare duration, the date of the observation and its instrument mode, and the flare emitted energy (using the model from Nowak et. al. 2012).
4) When you have all the necessary information, you can add to this database. To do so, you need a Github account. Then, you need to ask the one that owns this repository to be added as a contributor. After that, you can just upload the relevant files (either through the browser https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository or by the command line https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line). Make sure to add them in a relevant folder.
5) You are now ready to update the html table (FlareTable.html). Here's the basic idea behing the syntax: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp. Add a new row for the new flare (i.e., a new <tr> <\tr>, which each <td> <\td> in between being a column entry) and enter each value. Add the download links to your event file and your plot. To obtain them, go where you uploaded them in step 4 and right click on the "download" button. Select "copy link adress". You can now add the download links. For the right syntax, look at the other links already provided in the table.
6) You can open the html table in your browser to make sure everthing works. Once it works, you will need to tell Daryl to download the new html table to update the one in her website.
