May 22nd:

I think I will make a table with some info (to be determined) about each XVP/Post-XVP flare

I still need to figure out how to add download links pointing to a github repository. Otherwise, I will
put the files to be downloaded in the same folder as the html code. The problem with that is version control

Once this is done, I will push the html code to my mcgill physics domain

Guillochon did something much more complex, but this is the basic idea behind it
