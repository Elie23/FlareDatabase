May 22nd:

I think I will make a table with some info (to be determined) about each XVP/Post-XVP flare

I still need to figure out how to add download links pointing to a github repository. Otherwise, I will
put the files to be downloaded in the same folder as the html code. The problem with that is version control

Once this is done, I will push the html code to my mcgill physics domain

Guillochon did something much more complex, but this is the basic idea behind it

Guillochon used https://datatables.net/download/index to make his table. His download links point to his website, not github. He must update the website manually every time something changes on github. I should use the datatables thing too since it allows the table to be interactive (like searching for stuff) which will be necessary in the long run.
